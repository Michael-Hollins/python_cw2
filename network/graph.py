        ----------------------------------------------

        The returned graph should be a dictionary having the following form:
        {
            "station_A_id": {
                "neighbour_station_1_id": [
                                connection_1 (instance of Connection),
                                connection_2 (instance of Connection),
                                ...],

                "neighbour_station_2_id": [
                                connection_1 (instance of Connection),

        For instance, knowing that the id of "Hammersmith" station is "110",
        graph['110'] should be equal to:

                Connection(Hammersmith<->Ravenscourt Park, District Line, 2)
