    Task 1: Complete the definition of the TubeMap class by:

    Don't hesitate to divide your code into several sub-methods, if needed.

    As a minimum, the TubeMap class must contain these three member attributes:
    - stations: a dictionary that indexes Station instances by their id 
      (key=id (str), value=Station)
    - lines: a dictionary that indexes Line instances by their id 
      (key=id, value=Line)
    - connections: a list of Connection instances for the TubeMap 
      (list of Connections)

        During the import process, the `stations`, `lines` and `connections` 
        attributes should be updated.

        You can use the `json` python package to easily load the JSON file at 
        `filepath`

        Note: when the indicated zone is not an integer (for instance: "2.5"), 
            it means that the station belongs to two zones. 
            For example, if the zone of a station is "2.5", 
            it means that the station is in both zones 2 and 3.

        Args:
            filepath (str) : relative or absolute path to the JSON file 
                containing all the information about the tube map graph to 
                import. If filepath is invalid, no attribute should be updated, 
                and no error should be raised.
